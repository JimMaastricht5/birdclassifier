    "### Notebook to setup data for a tensorflow.keras train from dir\n",
    "The following code will read out the images in the NABirds dataset I kept in GCS.  Some additional manipulation is performed to get image names and keys to match the actual file names.  I looked at the suggested train/test split in the NABirds dataset.  They have a 50/50 split.  I'd prefer 80/20 so I worked a new column called Train_Validate to mark that split.  Train/Validate is what I have Keras setup to look for under the \"Images\" directory in GCS.  I also looked at the balance of images by bird and it ranges from 91 to 120 which is fairly balanced so I did no data enrichment.  "
